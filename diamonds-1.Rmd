## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r diamonds}
library(ggplot2)
data("diamonds")
summary(diamonds)
qplot(x = price, data = diamonds)
mean(diamonds$price)
median(diamonds$price)
summary(diamonds$price < 500)
summary(diamonds$price < 250)
summary(diamonds$price >= 15000)
```
```{r}
qplot(x = price, data = diamonds)
ggsave('priceHistogram1.png')

```
```{r}
qplot(x = price, data = diamonds, binwidth = 100)
scale_x_continuous(limits=c(1500, 2500))
```
```{r}
qplot(x = price, data= diamonds) +
  facet_wrap(~cut)

```
```{r}
by(diamonds$price, diamonds$cut, summary)
by(diamonds$price, diamonds$cut, min)
by(diamonds$price, diamonds$cut, max)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
